## Why am I taking this course?

I was following along Stephen Grider's courses for the past two weeks and as great as they are, once I saw that Brian launched the fourth iteration of his React course on FrontEndMasters, I knew that I should switch things up and spend my time with a React industry leader. 

In order to have the most up to date skills, you've got to learn things as soon as the best teachers teach them.
