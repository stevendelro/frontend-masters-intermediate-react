## Why am I taking this course?

This is the second course from Brian Holt's two-part React series.

My intention with this course is to get a better understanding of the current tools that many React developers are using in the workplace. Once completed, I'll be shifting all my focus on my portfolio, the projects within my portfolio, and solving a ton of coding problems. 

These repos aren't meant for anything other than a place to write my notes and to keep my self accountable. Also, I see it as a great way for any future developers to check out and see how my mind works. I'm no Michael Pollan, but my reading my writing would be the best way to get a feel for my personality without actually meeting me.

Anyway, enough with the introduction. 

Let's get started.
