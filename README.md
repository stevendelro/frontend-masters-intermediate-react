## Why am I taking this course?

I was following along Stephen Grider's courses for the past two weeks and as great as they are, once I saw that Brian Holt launched the fourth iteration of his React course on FrontEndMasters, I knew that I should switch things up and spend my time with a React industry leader. 

In order to have the most up to date skills, you've got to learn things as soon as the best teachers teach them.

## Notes:

### Pure React

  * Many other tutorials provide a GitHub repository to clone in which all the "magic" or modern tools that make React easier to work with come preconfigured and ready to go. **This is not one of those tutorials.**
  * Holt takes the approach of showing you how React works without any tools or dependencies. Once we understand certain concepts, he'll begin to introduce the tools *as solutions* to the inconveniences that we'll face when coding with React.
  * This will help remove the sense of "magic" that many people have when diving into a preconfigured course project folder, and I believe that it also provides a huge level of context and appreciation for the most common tools that many newbie React developers, like myself, may take for granted.
  * Towards the end of the Pure React section, Holt gives his opinion on how React's self-contained, component-based approach is so much more maintainable in a production environment than an Angular-based approach.
